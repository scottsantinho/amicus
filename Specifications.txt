## 6. Security Requirements
- Authentication method:
    - Utilize Django's built-in authentication system
    - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality
    - Use Django's User model for user management

- Authorization levels:
    - Implement Django's permission system
    - Define user groups (e.g., regular users, premium users, administrators)
    - Use Django's decorators (e.g., @login_required, @permission_required) for view-level access control
